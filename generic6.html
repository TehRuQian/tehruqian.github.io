							<h1 class="major">Technology and Information System</h1>
							<p>This course serves as an introductory introduction to information systems and technology (IS/IT) and how it can be used both at home and at work. There will be an introduction to several parts of IS/IT, including network, communications, hardware, and software. A significant part of the study will be focused in the labs where students will gain actual experience with PC installation and productivity applications. As part of work-based learning, this class regularly hosts seminars and visits from industry leaders. Students will be exposed to a real working environment, learn from the business, and see an increase in industry-university engagement through both industry visits and seminars. Additionally, the student does a quick investigation into the required skills and employment requirements for an IT career.</p>

							<h2>Assignment</h2>
							<h3>Assignment 1</h3>
							<embed src="files/TEH RU QIAN Career Development.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="600px" />
							<h3>Reflection</h3>
							<p> I was greatly influenced by this discussion regarding the important job application. I realize that before starting my internship program, I should start drafting my job application and making it the best. Apart from that, I'll make an effort to take part in more computer science related events like the upcoming Compfair in order to learn new skills that will be useful to me in the future.</p>
							<h3>Assignment 2</h3>

						</video-->
							<h3>Reflection</h3>
							<p>After visit UTM Digital Center, I learnt more about a concept of the actual working environment in the organization might be gained during an industrial visit. For instance, UTM Digital shows us around their open office, which has a workspace, a meeting room, and other areas for relaxation. Beside that, this industry visits also fill the knowledge gap between classroom instruction and practical knowledge in an actual workplace. When I visit the UTM data center, I are putting our theoretical knowledge into practice. In conclusion, this talk and visit to UTM Digital provided a better understanding of their main work and working environment, deepening our knowledge of computer-related topics.</p>
							<h3>Assignment 3</h3>

							<h3>Assignment 4</h3>
							<embed src="files/TIS Industrial Visit Newsletter (1).pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="600px" />
							<h3>Reflection</h3>
							<p>Both of the industry visits highlighted the importance of lifelong learning. Especially as a student of computer science, we cannot stop learning new things if we do not want to fall behind because technology is advancing daily. For instance, becoming a successful data engineer requires having a number of abilities, including analytical thinking, problem-solving, programming, productivity, and an awareness of the SDLC.</p>
							<h3>PC Assemble (Lab)</h3>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/PC assemble (2).jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<video width="450" height="340" controls>
								<source src="video/PC assemble (lab) (1).mp4" type="video/mp4"width="100%" height="600px"/>
							</video>
							<h3>Reflection</h3>
							<p>After PC Assemble, It deepens my knowledge about the roles of the CPU, GPU, RAM, motherboard, storage, and power supply. Reading manuals, watching tutorials, and troubleshooting during the assembly process contribute to a valuable learning experience.</p>
							<h3>Design Thinking</h3>
							<h4>Report</h4>
							<embed src="files/Group 6 TIS Design Thinking Assignment (1).pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="600px" />
							<h4>Presentation</h4>
							<embed src="files/Design Thinking Presentation_20240103_135607_0000.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="600px" />
							<h3>Reflection</h3>
							<p>According to my understanding, design thinking is an iterative process in which we try to find and solve problems in different ways. In my opinion, this project introduced me to the importance of identifying a problem and coming up with many creative and innovative solutions. I'll surely apply what I learn about design thinking to problem-solving in my everyday life.</p>
